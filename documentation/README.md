# BOTS Game Client Documentation

## Overview

This documentation covers the analysis of **two different BOTS game clients** that were analyzed as part of reverse engineering research:

1. **Original BOTS!! Client** (Yoda's Cryptor protected) - **FAILED** to decrypt
2. **Zylon Gaming BOTS Client** (Protector: ENIGMA) - **IN PROGRESS** - unpacked but analysis ongoing

## 📚 Research Context

### Original BOTS!! Client

The original client represents a **failed decryption attempt** that demonstrates the sophistication of Yoda's Cryptor protection. Despite extensive analysis, the multi-layer encryption and custom compression algorithms could not be defeated. **Critical limitation**: GameGuard anti-cheat system and game servers are offline, preventing proper initialization and entry point execution.

### Zylon Gaming BOTS Client

This client represents a **work in progress** - while successfully unpacked, the analysis is ongoing. We have access to the decompiled code but are still extracting and understanding the game's internal architecture, networking, anti-cheat systems, and game mechanics.
