# BOTS!! (BOUT!!) Preservation Project

A comprehensive reverse engineering and preservation effort for **BOTS!! (BOUT!!)**, a 3D mech action game developed by NLOG Soft between 2006-2008. This project aims to document, analyze, and preserve this Korean multiplayer mech combat game for future generations.

## üéÆ Game Overview

**BOTS!!** is a 3D multiplayer mech combat game featuring:

- **3 Robot Types**: Patch, Surge, and Ram with transformation mechanics
- **3 Game Modes**: Battle (PvP), Sector (PvE), and Base (defense/capture)
- **Advanced Engine**: Custom DirectX 9.0+ based 3D engine with particle effects
- **Multiplayer Focus**: Client-server architecture supporting team-based combat
- **Korean Origin**: Developed by NLOG Soft with 66 documented patches

## üîç Analysis Scope

### Content Analysis

- **5,000+ Game Assets**: Models, textures, audio, maps, and scripts
- **44 Maps**: Across multiple game modes and environments
- **4,000+ Models**: Characters, weapons, objects, and equipment
- **233+ Effects**: Particle systems and visual effects
- **330 Audio Files**: Combat sounds, movement, and ambiance

### Technical Analysis

- **File Format Reverse Engineering**: Custom binary formats (.ba0, .ba2, .bon, .bsc)
- **Script System Analysis**: UI layouts, configuration files, and localization
- **Network Architecture**: Multiplayer client-server communication and P2P protocols
- **Protection System**: GameGuard anti-cheat with Yoda's Cryptor 1.x packing
- **Protocol Analysis**: TCP packet structures and game state synchronization

## üõ°Ô∏è Protection System Analysis

The game uses sophisticated anti-tampering protection:

- **Yoda's Cryptor 1.x**: Multi-layer encryption and custom compression
- **GameGuard Integration**: Distributed external file-based protection system
- **Anti-Debugging**: Runtime code decryption and debugger detection
- **Custom Compression**: Proprietary algorithms with up to 54x expansion ratios

**Current Status**: Encryption layers defeated, architecture mapped, but execution challenges remain.

## üìö Documentation

### [Client Documentation](documentation/client/README.md)

Complete reverse engineering analysis of the game client, including game mechanics, file formats, scripts, protection systems, and network protocols.

### [Game Client Repository](https://github.com/segfaultincoming/bots-acclaim-clients)

The BOTS!! game clients have been moved to a dedicated GitHub repository for better organization and accessibility. This repository contains the original game client archives from 2008, including the protected executables and game assets for analysis.

### Key Findings

- **Engine**: Custom DirectX 9.0+ 3D engine with advanced features
- **Architecture**: Modular design with efficient asset management
- **Networking**: Sophisticated client-server multiplayer system
- **Localization**: Korean language support with internationalization

## üéØ Project Goals

1. **Preservation**: Document and preserve the game's technical architecture
2. **Open Source Server**: Create a fully functional, open-source multiplayer server
3. **Network Reverse Engineering**: Understand and replicate the P2P/TCP communication protocol
4. **Research**: Understand 2000s-era Korean game development techniques
5. **Education**: Provide insights into anti-cheat and protection systems
6. **Accessibility**: Make game mechanics and systems understandable
7. **Community Revival**: Enable multiplayer gameplay for preservation and research

## üéØ Current Development Goals

1. **Complete Client Unpacking**: Fully extract and reconstruct the `bots.dat` executable
2. **Bypass GameGuard Protection**: Remove or disable the anti-cheat initialization sequence
3. **Achieve Game Launch**: Successfully display the login screen

## üöß Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Asset Analysis**: Complete documentation of 5,000+ game files
- ‚úÖ **File Formats**: Reverse engineered custom binary formats
