## 🎯 Mission

To reverse engineer **BOTS (2006)** and create a comprehensive preservation package including:

- **🔧 Server implementation** with documented protocols and architecture analysis
- **📚 Complete client technical documentation** covering systems, mechanics, and internal structure
- **🔍 In-depth reverse engineering analysis** for educational and research purposes
- **🌐 Community revival tools** to keep this classic MMO playable

## 📖 The Journey

This repository documents my personal reverse engineering journey - from nostalgic discovery to technical deep-dive. Each day captures the challenges, breakthroughs, and lessons learned.

## 🌐 Community Servers

While working on creating our own server, you can play on these existing private servers:

- [**OhkaBOTS**](https://ohkabots.ohkaspace.com/) - Active community server
- [**BoutCheetah**](https://zylongaming.com/) - Another private server option

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Work in Progress**: This is an active reverse engineering project
- **Documentation Outdated**: The `documentation/` folder contains old info that will be updated upon completion
- **Educational Purpose**: This project is for educational and preservation purposes
